Version 1.12 -- Thu Sep 04, 2008

Added OPTIONS and EXAMPLES sections in the man page (Mike Loseke)
Log debugging information via syslog.
Added "cleanthisconfig" config command.  This is meant to be used in a
      system with multiple drbd mountpoints, started at different times.
      Each one would typically have it's own config file, which may not be
      available at system boot.  drbdlinks will now copy these files off to a
      safe location when it starts, and drbdlinksclean will run any of these
      it finds in addition to the normal drbdlinks.conf.
Adding a "/var/run/drbdlinks/configs-to-clean" directory, any config files
      that are in there will get cleaned by "drbdlinksclean" at system boot.
Modified monitor option so that it returns "stopped" instead of
      "not configured" if there is no configuration file.  Required for the
      multiple configurations.
